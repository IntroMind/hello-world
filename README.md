Welcome Intro-Mind's "sad attempt" at GitHub!
I call myself 'Intro-Mind' because I'm an introvert and my mind talks a lot; i.e. I think too much. I like learning about my mind and why I do certain things and believe certain things. I love to learn about myself, since I'm a compulsive follower. It makes me feel like a real individual.
