Welcome Intro-Mind's "sad attempt" at GitHub!

<hr>

I call myself 'Intro-Mind' because I'm an introvert and my mind talks a lot; i.e. I think too much. I like learning about how my mind works and why I do & believe certain things. I love to learn about myself because it makes me feel like a real individual.
